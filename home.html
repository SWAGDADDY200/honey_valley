</div>

<div class="nat">
    <h1 class="nat1">Natural Cough Medicine</h1>
    <p>Honey is a time honored remedy for a sore thorat. Accordingly to one study <br>
        it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medictaitons that <br>

<div class="lower">
    <h1 class="lower1"> Lowers Blood pressure </h1>
    <p>Blood Pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey <br>
        may help lower it. This is because it contains Antioxidants compounds that <br>
        have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans <br>
        have show modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.</p>
</div>

<div class="imp">

    <p>It's high in Antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavonoid, which may <br>
    support better health. Small studies in humans show honey's Antioxidants <br>
    could help improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk <br>
    for heart disease, although later long-term studies are needed to confirm <br>
    those findings.</p>
</div>

<div class="anit">
    <h1 class="anit1">Antibacterial properties</h1>
    <p>Honey contains hydrogyine peroxide, which may account for some of its <br>
    antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can help <br>
    stop growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level. <br>
This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get <br>
dehydrated and die off.</p>
