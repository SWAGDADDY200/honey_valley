    <h1 class="anit1">Antibacterial properties</h1>
    <p>Honey contains hydrogyine peroxide, which may account for some of its <br>
    antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can help <br>
    stop growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level. <br>
This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get <br>
dehydrated and die off.</p>
